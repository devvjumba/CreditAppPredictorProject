# CreditAppPredictorProject

This project looks to build a ML model to predict whether a credit card application will be successful. It uses data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. As this model will classify into successful or unsuccesful outcomes, a logistic regression model is used.

The notebook steps can be broken into:

1) Download and read the dataset
2) Inspect the anonymised data
3) Handle missing values
4) Convert non-numeric data into numeric
5) Split the data into train and test
6) Scale features
7) Fit a logistic regression model
8) Evaluate performance
9) Use grid searching to optimise
